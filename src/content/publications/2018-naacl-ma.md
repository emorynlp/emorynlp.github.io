  This paper presents a new corpus and a robust deep learning architecture for a task in
  reading comprehension, passage completion, on multiparty dialog. Given a dialog in text and
  a passage containing factual descriptions about the dialog where mentions of the characters
  are replaced by blanks, the task is to fill the blanks with the most appropriate character
  names that reflect the contexts in the dialog. Since there is no dataset that challenges the
  task of passage completion in this genre, we create a corpus by selecting transcripts from a
  TV show that comprise 1,681 dialogs, generating passages for each dialog through
  crowdsourcing, and annotating mentions of characters in both the dialog and the passages.
  Given this dataset, we build a deep neural model that integrates rich feature extraction
  from convolutional neural networks into sequence modeling in recurrent neural networks,
  optimized by utterance and dialog level attentions. Our model outperforms the previous
  state-of-the-art model on this task in a different genre using bidirectional LSTM, showing a
  13.0+% improvement for longer dialogs. Our analysis shows the effectiveness of the attention
  mechanisms and suggests a direction to machine comprehension on multiparty dialog.
